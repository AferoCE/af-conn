This file contains notes pertaining to the setup of the firewall for Bento:

a) The file afero_whitelist.txt  (in dir: connectivity/pkg/files/etc/config)
   - List the server URLs or addresses of the Afero servers used for connectivity services.
   - The whitelist indicates that the specified server are allowed network acesss on bento.
   - Format of the whitelist in the file: each URL or address is a single entry. Supports comment and while space/line.

   - The whitelist file is read in the script file: create_afero_whitelist.sh
      - an incoming permit rule is created for each entry in whitelist 
      - an output permit rule is created for each entry in the whitelist 

b) script file: create_afero_whitelist.sh 
   - in dir: connectivity/pkg/files/etc/config
   - on bento: can be found on the /etc/config/create_afero_whitelist.sh 
   - Create the incoming and outgoing rules for each whitelist server.
   - Invoked through the firewall reload mechanism. 

		See: /etc/init.d/firewall 

   - in the file /etc/config/firewall.user (on bento), it specifies the afero firewall rules, which
     includes the creation of the whitelist rule chains by invoking the the script 
	 create_afero_whitelist.sh.
		
		see: /etc/firewall.user

   - The firewall can be reloaded via the openwrt hotplug.  For example: the command "wifi down" 
     takes down the wifi interface.  And the "wifi up" brings up the wifi interface "wlan0". The hotplug 
     mechanism detects the wifi inerface wwlan0 is up, and initiate the firewall reload (which 
     updates firewall rules).   

	 	see /etc/hotplug.d/iface/20-firewall


c) connectivity/pkg/files/etc/config/firewall.bento 
   - TODO deployment: this file should replace /etc/config/firewall 


Below pictures depicts events that triggers the firewall:

	(wifi up)  (reboot) 
	  |           |
      |           |
      |           |
	  V           V 
	/etc/config/firewall
        |
        | -- call /etc/firewall.user 
        |
        | -- call /etc/config/create_afero_whitelist.sh 


d) script file: switch_route_to.sh 
   - this is used by the connmgr to switch route between the interfaces, hence 
     managing or setup priority of the default route being used. 
   - in dir: connectivity/pkg/src/connd) 
   - can be found in dir /usr/bin/switch_route_to.sh on bento 




Testing
=======
On a bento console (either through serial or ssh), the following command
reload the firewall rules:

 > fw3 reload

This reload the firewall rules.


Another way to test is to turn the wifi off, and then turn the wifi on again:
 > wifi off
 > wifi on
